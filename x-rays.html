            <h3>Examples of Radiation (and What's Not Radiation)</h3>
            <p>Radiation is the emission and propagation of energy. A substance does not need to be radioactive in order to emit radiation because radiation encompasses all forms of energy, not just those produced by radioactive decay. However, all radioactive materials do emit radiation.</p>
            <p>Key Takeaways: Radiation Examples</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Radiation is emitted whenever energy is propagated.</li>
                <li> A substance does not need to be radioactive to emit radiation.</li>
                <li>Not all isotopes of element emit radiation.</li>
                <li>Common examples of radiation include light, heat, and alpha particles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here are some examples of different types of radiation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ultraviolet light from the sun</li>
                <li>heat from a stove burner</li>
                <li>visible light from a candle</li>
                <li>x-rays from an x-ray machine</li>
                <li>alpha particles emitted from the radioactive decay of uranium</li>
                <li>sound waves from your stereo</li>
                <li>microwaves from a microwave oven</li>
                <li>electromagnetic radiation from your cell phone</li>
                <li>ultraviolet light from a black light</li>
                <li>beta particle radiation from a sample of strontium-90</li>
                <li>gamma radiation from a supernova</li>
                <li>microwave radiation from your wifi router</li>
                <li>radio waves</li>
                <li>a laser beam</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As you can see, most of the examples on this list are examples from the electromagnetic spectrum, but the energy source doesn't need to be light or magnetism to qualify as radiation. Sound, after all, is a different form of energy. Alpha particles are moving, energetic helium nuclei (particles).</p>
            <h4>Examples of Things That Are Not Radiation</h4>
            <p>It's important to realize isotopes are not always radioactive. For example deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen that is not radioactive. A glass of heavy water at room temperature does not emit radiation. (A warm glass of heavy water emits radiation as heat.)</p>
            <p>A more technical example has to do with the definition of radiation. An energy source may be capable of emitting radiation, but if the energy doesn't propagate outward, it's not radiating. Take, for example, a magnetic field. If you hook up a coil of wire to a battery and form an electromagnet, the magnetic field it generates (actually an electromagnetic field) is a form a radiation. However, the magnetic field surrounding the Earth is not typically considered radiation because it's not "detached" or propagating outward off into space.</p>

     <h3>Spectrum Definition in Chemistry</h3>
     <p>A spectrum is defined as the characteristic wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation (or a portion thereof) that is emitted or absorbed by an object or substance, atom, or molecule.</p>


           <p><b>Plural:</b> Spectra</p>            
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>Examples of a spectrum include the rainbow, the emission colors from the Sun, and the infrared absorption wavelengths from a molecule.</p>

         <h3>Wavelength Definition in Science</h3>
<p>The wavelength is a property of a wave that is the distance between identical points between two successive waves. The distance between one crest (or trough) of one wave and the next is the wavelength of the wave. In equations, wavelength is indicated using the Greek letter lambda (λ).</p>
<h4>Wavelength Examples</h4>
<p>The wavelength of light determines its color and the wavelength of sound determines the pitch. The wavelengths of visible light extend from about 700 nm (red) to 400 nm (violet). The wavelength of audible sound range from about 17 mm to 17 m. Wavelengths of audible sound are much longer than those of visible light.</p> 
<h4>Wavelength Equation</h4>
<p>The wavelength λ is related to the phase velocity v and the wave's frequency f by the following equation:</p> 
<p>λ = v/f<p></p>
<p>For example, the phase speed of light in free space is approximately 3×10<sup>8</sup> m/s, so the wavelength of light is the speed of light divided by its frequency.</p>

         <h3>Frequency Definition in Science</h3>
         <p>In the most general sense, frequency is defined as the number of times an event occurs per unit of time. In physics and chemistry, the term frequency is most often applied to waves, including light, sound, and radio. Frequency is the number of times a point on a wave passes a fixed reference point in one second.</p>
         <p>The period or duration of time of a cycle of a wave is the reciprocal (1 divided by) of frequency. The SI unit for frequency is the Hertz (Hz), which is equivalent to the older unit cycles per second (cps). Frequency is also known as cycles per second or temporal frequency. The usual symbols for frequency are the Latin letter f or the Greek letter ν (nu).</p>
         <h4>Examples of Frequency</h4>
         <p>Although the standard definition of frequency is based on events per second, other units of time may be used, such as minutes or hours.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For example, a human heart may beat at a frequency of 68 beats per minute.</li>
  <li>A 78 record on a turntable turns at the rate of 78 revolutions per minute or 78 rpm.</li>

       <h3>Wavelengths of visible light</h3>
<p>Some people can see further into the ultraviolet and infrared ranges than others, so the "visible light" edges of red and violet are not well-defined. Also, seeing well into one end of the spectrum doesn't necessarily mean you can see well into the other end of the spectrum. You can test yourself using a prism and a sheet of paper. Shine a bright white light through the prism to produce a rainbow on the paper. Mark the edges and compare the size of your rainbow with that of others.</p>
<p>The wavelegths of visible light are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Violet:</b> 380-450 nm (688-789 THz frequency)</li>
  <li><b>Blue:</b> 450-495 nm</li>
  <li><b>Green:</b> 495-570 nm</li>
  <li><b>Yellow:</b> 570-590 nm</li>
  <li><b>Orange:</b> 590-620 nm</li>
  <li><b>Red:</b> 620-750 nm (400-484 THz frequency)</li>
</ul>
<p>Violet light has the shortest wavelength, which means it has the highest frequency and energy. Red has the longest wavelength, the shortest frequency, and the lowest energy.</p>
<h4>The Special Case of Indigo</h4>
<p>There is no wavelength assigned to indigo. If you want a number, it's around 445 nanometers, but it doesn't appear on most spectra. There's a reason for this. Sir Isaac Newton coined the word spectrum (Latin for "appearance") in 1671 in his book "Opticks." He divided the spectrum into seven sections—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—in keeping with the Greek sophists, to connect the colors to days of the week, musical notes, and the known objects of the solar system.</p>
<p>So, the spectrum was first described with seven colors, but most people, even if they see color well, can't actually distinguish indigo from blue or violet. The modern spectrum typically omits indigo. In fact, there is evidence Newton's division of the spectrum doesn't even correspond to the colors we define by wavelengths. For example, Newton's indigo is the modern blue, while his blue corresponds to the color we refer to as cyan. Is your blue the same as my blue? Probably, but it may not be the same as Newton's.</p>
<h4>Colors People See That Aren't on the Spectrum</h4>
<p>The visible spectrum does not encompass all the colors humans perceive because the brain also perceives unsaturated colors (e.g., pink is an unsaturated form of red) and colors that are a mixture of wavelengths (e.g., magenta). Mixing colors on a palette produces tints and hues not seen as spectral colors.</p>
<h4>Colors Only Animals Can See</h4>
<p>Just because humans can't see beyond the visible spectrum doesn't mean animals are similarly restricted. Bees and other insects can see ultraviolet light, which is commonly reflected by flowers. Birds can see into the ultraviolet range (300-400 nanometers) and have plumage visible in UV.</p>
<p>Humans see further into the red range than most animals. Bees can see color up to about 590 nanometers, which is just before orange starts. Birds can see red, but not as far toward the infrared range as humans.</p>
<p>Some people believe goldfish are the only animal that can see both infrared and ultraviolet light, but this notion is incorrect. In fact, goldfish cannot see infrared light.</p>

        <h3>What the Compton Effect Is and How It Works in Physics</h3>
        <p>The Compton effect (also called Compton scattering) is the result of a high-energy photon colliding with a target, which releases loosely bound electrons from the outer shell of the atom or molecule. The scattered radiation experiences a wavelength shift that cannot be explained in terms of classical wave theory, thus lending support to Einstein's photon theory. Probably the most important implication of the effect is that it showed light could not be fully explained according to wave phenomena. Compton scattering is one example of a type of inelastic scattering of light by a charged particle. Nuclear scattering also occurs, although the Compton effect typically refers to the interaction with electrons.</p>
        <p>The effect was first demonstrated in 1923 by Arthur Holly Compton (for which he received a 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics). Compton's graduate student, Y.H. Woo, later verified the effect.</p>
        <h4>How Compton Scattering Works</h4>
        <p>The scattering is demonstrated is pictured in the diagram. A high-energy photon (generally X-ray or gamma-ray) collides with a target, which has loosely-bound electrons in its outer shell. The incident photon has the following energy E and linear momentum p:</p> 
        <p>E = hc / lambda</p> 
        <p>p = E / c</p>
        <p>The photon gives part of its energy to one of the almost-free electrons, in the form of kinetic energy, as expected in a particle collision. We know that total energy and linear momentum must be conserved. Analyzing these energy and momentum relationships for the photon and electron, you end up with three equations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>energy</li>
          <li>x-component momentum</li>
          <li>y-component momentum</li>
            <p>... in four variables:</p>
          <li>phi, the scattering angle of the electron</li>
          <li>theta, the scattering angle of the photon</li>
          <li>Ee, the final energy of the electron</li>
          <li>E', the final energy of the photon</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we care only about the energy and direction of the photon, then the electron variables can be treated as constants, meaning that it's possible to solve the system of equations. By combining these equations and using some algebraic tricks to eliminate variables, Compton arrived at the following equations (which are obviously related, since energy and wavelength are related to photons):</p>
        <p>1 / E' - 1 / E = 1/( me c<sup>2</sup>) * (1 - cos theta)</p>
        <p>lambda' - lambda = h/(me c) * (1 - cos theta)</p>
        <p>The value h/(me c) is called the Compton wavelength of the electron and has a value of 0.002426 nm (or 2.426 x 10<sup>-12</sup> m). This isn't, of course, an actual wavelength, but really a proportionality constant for the wavelength shift.</p>
        <h4>Why Does This Support Photons?</h4>
        <p>This analysis and derivation are based on a particle perspective and the results are easy to test. Looking at the equation, it becomes clear that the entire shift can be measured purely in terms of the angle at which the photon gets scattered. Everything else on the right side of the equation is a constant. Experiments show that this is the case, giving great support to the photon interpretation of light.</p>

<h3>Atomic Weight Definition</h3>
<p>Atomic weight is the average mass of atoms of an element, calculated using the relative abundance of isotopes in a naturally-occurring element. It is the weighted average of the masses of naturally-occurring isotopes.</p>
<h4>What Is It Based On?</h4>
<p>Prior to 1961, a unit of atomic weight was based on 1/16th (0.0625) of the weight of an oxygen atom. After this point, the standard was changed to be 1/12th the weight of a carbon-12 atom in its ground state. A carbon-12 atom is assigned 12 atomic mass units. The unit is dimensionless.</p>
<h4>More Commonly Known as Relative Atomic Mass</h4>
<p>Atomic mass is used interchangeably with atomic weight, although the two terms don't mean precisely the same thing. Another issue is that "weight" implies a force exerted in a gravitational field, which would be measured in units of force, like newtons. The term "atomic weight" has been in use since 1808, so most people don't really care about the issues, but to reduce confusion, atomic weight is more commonly known now as relative atomic mass.</p>
<h4>Abbrevition</h4>
<p>The usual abbreviation for atomic weight in texts and references is at wt or at. wt.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The atomic mass of carbon is 12.011</li>
  <li>The atomic mass of hydrogen is 1.0079.</li>
  <li>The atomic weight of boron samples collected on Earth falls within a range of 10.806 to 10.821.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Synthetic Elements</h4>
<p>For synthetic elements, there is no natural isotope abundance. So, for these elements, the total nucleon count (sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus) is usually cited in the place of the standard atomic weight. The value is given within brackets so that it's understood it's the nucleon count and not a natural value.</p>
<h4>Related Terms</h4>
<p><b>Atomic Mass</b> - Atomic mass is the mass of an atom or other particle, expressed in unified atomic mass units (u). An atomic mass unit is defined as 1/12th the mass of a carbon-12 atom. Since the mass of electrons is much smaller than that of protons and neutrons, the atomic mass is nearly identical to the mass number. Atomic mass is denoted with the symbol m<sub>a</sub>.</p>
<p><b>Relative Isotopic Mass</b> - This is the ratio of the mass of a single atom to the mass of a unified atomic mass unit. This is synonymous with atomic mass.</p>
<p><b>Standard Atomic Weight</b> - This is the expected atomic weight or relative atomic mass of an element sample in the Earth's crust and atmosphere. It is an average of relative isotope masses for an element from samples collected all over the Earth, so this value is subject to change as new element sources are discovered. The standard atomic weight of an element is the value cited for atomic weight on the periodic table.</p>

<h3>What Happens If You X-Ray Metal?</h3>
<p>Metal appears as a bright area on an x-ray, blocking visibility of underlying structures. The reason you're asked to remove metal is to give the radiologist an unobstructed view of the area of interest. Basically, you remove metal because it blocks anatomy. If you have a metal implant, obviously you can't remove it for an x-ray, but if the technician is aware of it, he may position you differently to get the best imaging results or take x-rays from multiple angles.</p>
<p>The reason metal appears bright on the x-ray image is that it is extremely dense, so x radiation does not penetrate it as well as it does soft tissues. This is also why bones appear bright on an x-ray. Bones are denser than blood, cartilage, or soft organs.</p>
<h4>The Issue of Metal in the X-Ray Room</h4>
<p>Unless the metal item is directly in the path between the x-ray collimator and the image receptor, there's no issue having metal objects in the same room as an x-ray machine. On the other hand, metal objects are not permitted in a room housing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment because the objects will be drawn toward the powerful magnets when the machine is turned on. Then, the problem isn't with the image. It's a matter of the items because of hazardous projectiles, which could injure people or damage equipment.</p>

<h3>Spectroscopy Definition</h3>
<p>Spectroscopy is the analysis of the interaction between matter and any portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Traditionally, spectroscopy involved the visible spectrum of light, but x-ray, gamma, and UV spectroscopy also are valuable analytical techniques. Spectroscopy may involve any interaction between light and matter, including absorption, emission, scattering, etc.</p> 
<p>Data obtained from spectroscopy is usually presented as a spectrum (plural: spectra) that is a plot of the factor being measured as a function of either frequency or wavelength. Emission spectra and absorption spectra are common examples.</p>
<h4>The Basics of How Spectroscopy Works</h4>
<p>When a beam of electromagnetic radiation passes through a sample, the photons interact with the sample. They may be absorbed, reflected, refracted, etc. Absorbed radiation affects the electrons and chemical bonds in a sample. In some cases, the absorbed radiation leads to the emission of lower energy photons. Spectroscopy looks at how the incident radiation affects the sample. Emitted and absorbed spectra can be used to gain information about the material. Because the interaction depends on the wavelength of radiation, there are many different types of spectroscopy.</p>
<h4>Spectroscopy Versus Spectrometry</h4>
<p>In practice, the terms "spectroscopy" and "spectrometry" are used interchangeably (except for mass spectrometry), but the two words don't mean exactly the same thing. The word spectroscopy comes from the Latin word specere, meaning "to look at" and the Greek word skopia, meaning "to see". The ending of the word spectrometry comes from the Greek word metria, meaning "to measure". Spectroscopy studies the electromagnetic radiation produced by a system or the interaction between the system and light, usually in a nondestructive manner. Spectrometry is the measurement of electromagnetic radiation in order to obtain information about a system. In other words, spectrometry may be considered a method of studying spectra.</p>
<p>Examples of spectrometry include mass spectrometry, Rutherford scattering spectrometry, ion mobility spectrometry, and neutron triple-axis spectrometry. The spectra produced by spectrometry aren't necessarily intensity versus frequency or wavelength. For example, a mass spectrometry spectrum plots intensity versus particle mass.</p>
<p>Another common term is spectrography, which refers to methods of experimental spectroscopy. Both spectroscopy and spectography refer to radiation intensity versus wavelength or frequency.</p>
<p>Devices used to take spectral measurements include spectrometer, spectrophotometers, spectral analyzers, and spectrographs.</p>
<h4>Uses of Spectroscopy</h4>
<p>Spectroscopy may be used to identify the nature of compounds in a sample. It is used to monitor the progress of chemical processes and to assess the purity of products. It may also be used to measure the effect of electromagnetic radiation on a sample. In some cases, this can be used to determine the intensity or duration of exposure to the radiation source.</p>
<h4>Classifying Spectroscopy</h4>
<p>There are multiple ways to classify types of spectroscopy. The techniques may be grouped according to the type of radiative energy (e.g., electromagnetic radiation, acoustic pressure waves, particles such as electrons), the type of material being studied (e.g., atoms, crystals, molecules, atomic nuclei), the interaction between the material and the energy (e.g., emission, absorption, elastic scattering), or by specific applications (e.g., Fourier transform spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy).</p>

X-radiation wavelength ranges from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, or frequencies from 3×10<sup>16</sup> Hz to 3×10<sup>19</sup> Hz. This puts the x-ray wavelength between ultraviolet light and gamma rays. The distinction between x-ray and gamma rays may be based on wavelength or on radiation source. Sometimes x-radiation is considered to be radiation emitted by electrons, while gamma radiation is emitted by the atomic nucleus.</p>

        <p>X-rays range in energy from 100 eV to 100 keV (below 0.2–0.1 nm wavelength). Hard x-rays are those with photon energies greater than 5-10 keV. Soft x-rays are those with lower energy. The wavelength of hard x-rays is comparable to the diameter of an atom. Hard x-rays have sufficient energy to penetrate matter, while soft x-rays are absorbed in air or penetrate water to a depth of about 1 micrometer.</p>

        <p>X-rays may be emitted whenever sufficiently energetic charged particles strike matter. Accelerated electrons are used to produce x-radiation in an x-ray tube, which is a vacuum tube with a hot cathode and a metal target. Protons or other positive ions may also be used. For example, proton-induced x-ray emission is an analytical technique. Natural sources of x-radiation include radon gas, other radioisotopes, lightning, and cosmic rays.</p>

      <p>X-rays are a form of ionizing radiation, able to break chemical bonds and ionize atoms. When x-rays were first discovered, people suffered radiation burns and hair loss. There were even reports of deaths. While radiation sickness is largely a thing of the past, medical x-rays are a significant source of man-made radiation exposure, accounting for about half the total radiation exposure from all sources in the U.S. in 2006. There is disagreement about the dose that presents a hazard, partially because risk depends on multiple factors.
